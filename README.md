BAN-Internet-Trolls or banit
----------------------------

Configurable service that monitors/scrapes and matches given logs for given regex patterns.
Utilizing IPTables it then bans matching IPs based on given condition(s).

See conf/banit.conf for details of what's possible.

This was developed due to my annoyance with constant (mostly SSH) hacking attempts.
